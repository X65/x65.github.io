We have a new Project Logo! ðŸŽ‰

I went with `MÎ›TEJ`'s idea of having a Lynx as the mascot and designed the branding around it.

<img src="/media/2024-09-30_paw_logo.svg" width="320" title="X65 Paw Logo">

It also looks cool when simplified in PETSCII.

I've made a few attempts to generate a Lynx mascot picture
but couldn't get any acceptable output from the available AI generators.
This will need more time.
