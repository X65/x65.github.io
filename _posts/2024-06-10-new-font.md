The default text mode font is now aligned with CP437 and includes PETSCII and ATASCII semigraphics.

I did my best to align the font with ASCII codes in the `0-31` range,
which is why some symbols are in different places compared to the default VGA font of CP437.

I also placed box-drawing characters in the same locations as in CP437.
(Almost - one character got moved.)

The remaining semigraphics are arranged in reasonable order,
wherever there was place and the ordering seemed logical.
