Presented the X65 Project at [Games & Vintage Days WrocÅ‚aw][1] 2025.

The response was great! ðŸŽ‰  
People kept coming over, asking questions, and showing real curiosity.  
Many were impressed by the idea, the execution, and the look of the machine.

Even visitors outside the retro scene showed interest in getting one to experiment with.
Not a single negative comment all weekend.

Kids especially loved playing Sokoban - our one working game so far. ðŸ˜¸
