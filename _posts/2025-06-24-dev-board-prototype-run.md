It's happening, guysâ€¦ ðŸ¥³

`Rev1` of the [DEV-board][1] has just gone into production.

It is being built by the awesome guys at [PCBWay][2].
The quality should be amazing - as usual with them. ðŸ¦¾

Let me remind you, though, this is not a final product.

This is `Milestone 1` on the way to the complete X65 microcomputer.  
These boards will allow us to test and debug the hardware,
finish the OS/816 operating system, and write/port some actually useful applications.

The complete machine will be in the all-in-one keyboard computer form factor:

* Standard 60% QWERTY keyboard (customization possible)
* I/O ports at the back and sides; layout similar to DEV-board
  * plus 6 extra USB ports (not present on DEV-board)
* Hardware bays, in the style of how Amiga/MSX computers mounted disk drives

Iâ€™ve got a pretty clear vision already.  
Now to make the CAD design and figure out how to 3D-print it.
