The Raspberry Pi Foundation revealed [RP2350 microcontroller][1] chip today.

What does this mean for the X65 project?

It (most probably) means that we can use a single RP2350B chip instead of two RP2040s
and get back to using QPI PSRAM, which is hardware-supported now.
The new HSTX hardware should also make driving HDMI video more robust.

However, we need to wait for the chip's general availability.
In the meantime, I am already working on the migration path
and will start migrating the firmware as soon as I receive the Pico2 development boards.
