title: GPIO over DE-9 ports

A poll on X65 Discord revealed that we do want to have support of 8-bit-era-style joysticks.

Even with recent RP2350 migration, we do not have 10 GPIO pins to spare,
so we need a general-purpose I/O chip connected to the CPU's address space.

One option is to take the venerable [VIA][1] chip and connect it to CPU bus.

There are two problems with that:

1. X65 runs on [non-monothonic clock]({% post_url 2024-03-07-VAB-memory-optimization %})
   and VIA will not tolerate it - internal clocks will go awry.
2. The chip is _expensive_â€¦ - almost as expensive as CPU.

Other option is to use a modern GPIO extender chip with a modern serial bus.
There is a good candidate: [MCP23X17][2] series. This device family provides 16-bit,
general purpose parallel I/O expansion for I2C or SPI bus, that can be split
into two 8-bit GPIO ports.

This is perfect. We can have two 9-pin (8 bits + GND) joysticks ports,
that can be configured to handle any controller type with [all kinds of standards][3].

Additionally, this setup allows the ports to function as a GPIO connector for various user devices.
