Once the DEV-boards are in production, I need to start thinking about moving
to the next milestone of designing and building the full computer.  
First item on the TODO-list is the keyboard.

For a long time, I've been looking for a pre-made oridinary keyboard with the layout
I wanted, to keep the cost of the machine down.  
I even found out a workable one, but in pretty low quality and not available in bulk.

After some research on building custom keyboard, I've decided it is not that hard
and I should just build my own design. What could go wrong…

This is the [X65 keyboard layout][1]{:target="_blank"} I've envisioned:

I'm sure you can see the inspiration and the look and form factor I am going for.

Top two rows are packed and ortholinear, specifically so you could rearrange keys
to one of these wild layouts envisioned by [Android Arts][2]:

I am also exploring options for customizing layout of ISO/ANSI Enter key:

and for additional keys instead LEDs, if someone wishes to…
