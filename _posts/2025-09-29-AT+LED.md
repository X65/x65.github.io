Working on RGB leds support on DEV-board.

This is how we roll‚Ä¶

It turns out I've connected RGB LEDs wrong‚Ä¶ (don't ask‚Ä¶ ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  
In order to work on LEDs support in firmware, I've disabled on-board ones
(there's a PCB jumper for this) and wired an external LED board.

Since the RGB LEDs are connected to ESP32, which is running `esp-at` firmware,  
in order to set LED colors, I needed to implement new AT command to set LEDs values.

Introducing: `AT+LED=3,28,224,0`
