Added HW RGB LEDs display to Emu.

The RGB LEDs use a very simple, yet extensive interface
for an RGB LED chain mapped to `$FFA0`-`$FFA7`:

The first four bytes are direct controls of the first four reds,  
with values in RGB332 format.

The next four bytes are an interface for all LEDs in the chain.

1. You write the requested RGB values to `$FFA5` (R), `$FFA6` (G), `$FFA7` (B).
2. You write the number of the LED you want to set to the selected color to `$FFA4`.

This allows control of up to 256 LEDs, including the first three
built into the X65 machine keyboard.

The simple one-byte interface for the first four LEDs is meant to make trivial
LED blinking a single `STA` operation.
