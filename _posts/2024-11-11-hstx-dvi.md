I've replaced PicoDVI library with custom HSTX code for DVI (HDMI) signal generation.

RP2350 chip has new, dedicated hardware for driving high speed, output-only data stream over GPIOs.
Coupled with new, dedicated hardware TMDS encoder it can be used to generate DVI video.

This combination is so powerfull, that I was able to completely remove PicoDVI library
and replace it with ~100 lines of very straightforward code.
It supports horizontal and vertical pixel doubling
and can easily push full ``768x480` pixels in full 24bit RGB, with no sweatâ€¦
