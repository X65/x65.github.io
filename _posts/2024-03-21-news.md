Site was rewritten in Jekyll.

This will allow adding news posts easily. Just create a file, commit and in a few
moments there is a new post on the X65.zone site.

The repository README doubles as index page, so every angle of web presence is in sync.

I will also back-post past news that was posted on Discord and social media.
