Got [RP6502 Picocomputer][1] [RIA firmware][2] running on my breadboard build.

This is basically unmodified `rp6502` firmware, that I will base my code on.

I do not want to reinvent the wheel. `rp6502` project did all the heavy lifting
already, the code is very clean and easy to follow. Even with my rusted C skills.
