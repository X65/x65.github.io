After RP2350 migration we have enough GPIO pins to spare some to play simple [PWM][1] sounds.

I have wired a simple audio circuit from RP2040 hardware design document and it works just fine.

This posed a question: How to mix it with output coming off SD-1 synthesizer.

- Synthesizer has two output channels.
- We have two PWM channels.

Mix them all together? Mix PWM1 to LEFT channel and PWM2 to RIGHT channel?

Maybe let the user decide? ðŸ¤”
So, I started researching digitally controlled audio mixersâ€¦

I have found some chips that would fit perfectly,
but these are not produced for more than a decade.
Fortunately there are some automotive chips still available,
which could be repurposed for my goal.

I've decided on [ROHM BD3461FS][2] mixer.
If I merge its 6 output channels into two L/R channels, it would work as we need.

This chip has some unusual pitch, thus putting it on breadboard is also unusual ðŸ˜œ

It is wired as follows:

- `INF1`/`2` - Yamaha SD-1 synthesizer
- `INR1`/`2` - line-in cinch (x2)
- `INS1`/`2` - expansion port (to allow sound card type expansion)
- `EXT1` - PWM channel 1
- `EXT2` - PWM channel 2
- `EXT3` - expansion port
- `OUT*1`/`2` - line-out cinch (x2) - three pairs joined together, so there is a mix of all IN-puts.

Then I tried, whether playing sampled sound over PWM worksâ€¦
