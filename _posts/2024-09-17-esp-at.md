Today X65 started talking to the Internet.

This marks a significant milestone toward achieving its goal of being "usable for daily basis computing".

The networking functionality is powered by an ESP32-C3 chip running the ESP-AT[1] firmware.
Operating similarly to a [Hayes AT][2] modem, where you can "dial" an IP address over Wi-Fi.

All features are exposed over an extensive set of AT commands, enabling connections to IP ports, fetching web pages, and transmitting data through simple data streams over UART.

Below is a quick demonstration of its operation using the built-in monitor software:
