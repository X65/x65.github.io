title: Custom SGU-1 sound chip

X65 just got a new custom sound chip, called **SGU-1 - Sound Generator Unit 1**.

We've been doing a lot of soul searching on how to provide a cool synth chip
in the light when nobody is willing to produce such anymore.

I ended up with the conclusion, that we need to build one ourselves.
We lack the expertise, so we are just piggy-backing on someone that knows his stuff.
X65 new sound chip is based on [*tildearrow Sound Unit*][1],
just wrapped in a memory-mapped register interface.

You can hear the quick PoC of a player playing Rob Hubbard's Monty On The Run SID tune,
over a trivial register-translation to *tSU* registers,
on the web X65 Emu-lator: <https://x65.zone/emu/?rom=roms/MontyOnTheRun.xex#Emu>

It's not perfect. It's a quick proof-of-concept hack.  
It shows the potential though…

I hope you like what we are doing with this… 😅
