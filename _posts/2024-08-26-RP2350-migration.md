RIA firmware migrated to RP2350.

Every feature of previous design was validated and works fine.

Two directories of `ria/` and `vpu/` were merged and unified.
It builds just one `rp816` firmware binary. I have to admit that not having to split work
between two RP2040 chips simplifies the code greatly.
