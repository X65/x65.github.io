X65 got its own MODE7 inspired by famous SNES MODE7.

Allows full affine transform of color indexed texture.

Texture can be as big as `256px x 256px`, but this is not practical.
Such texture would take full `64kB` bank of memory, leaving no place for Display List.
(Technically you could make DL part of your picture and get away with itâ€¦ ðŸ˜…)

Demo displays a `128px x 128px` picture.
Rotation vector is given simply by taking values from two sin/cos tables.

`128px` wide pixmap is exactly 1/3 of X65 horizontal resolution of `384px`,
So after setting a `3x` horizontal scaling factor, you can display it full-screen with no distortion.
