I've [assembled][1] a short program looping on STA instruction,
put it in `0000` address using monitor,
set RESET Vector to `0000` and started 65816 CPUâ€¦

As you can see the processor did the proper RESET sequence (reading some "random" memory addresses),
then `R`ead the RESET Vector (`0000`) from address `FFFC-FFFD`,
then `R`ead the `STA $1234` instruction from addresses `0000-0002`,
then did a `W`rite to address `1234`, next `R`ead `JMP $0000` instruction from addresses `0003-0005`
and looped back to `R`eading from `0000`. âž¿

RIA memory emulation code is done! ðŸŽ‰
