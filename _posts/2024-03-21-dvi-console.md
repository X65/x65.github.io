Done rewriting text mode console to [DVI][1] output.

Replaced demo font with [Atari ST 8x8][2] font, which is being rendered as 8Ã—16, due to raster line doubling on DVI output. Looks amazing. ðŸŽ‰

This will be the default font for [CGIA][3] text mode too.
As it works so good stretched to 1Ã—2 pixels, we can have one font for both 40Ã—30 and 80Ã—30 text modes.
