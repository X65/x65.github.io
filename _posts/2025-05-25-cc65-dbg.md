title: VS Code Debugger Extension for X65 Emu

While working on OS/816, setting the breakpoints manually in each debugging session got annoying to the point that I decided to write a proper VS Code debugger extension for X65 Emu.

Introducing [`cc65-dbg` VS Code debugger extension][1]!

This VS Code extension adds syntax and debugger support for cc65 and ca65.
It works with an adapter/emulator supporting the [Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)][2].

The main job of this extension is to parse the [debug info][3] file generated by
`ld65 --dbgfile` and use the information to drive the debugger executable.
It expects the file to be placed beside the "program" binary, with a `.dbg` extension.

The idea is that your debugger/adapter should not know about the format of the source
nor the assembler or compiler. It should just support breakpoints and interactive debugging.
On the other side, the debugging extension for a particular assembler/compiler should work
with many debuggers/emulators that support the DAP protocol.

Supports:

- Breakpoint synchronization between Emulator and VS Code
- CPU registers inspector and watch
- Module-scoped Globals view
- Disassembly view
- Memory view
- Arbitrary watch expressions

I've recorded a video explaining how to set it up for modern 6502/65816 assembly development in VS Code:
