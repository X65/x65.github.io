I've spent last week rewriting the Tech Demos for real machine hardware.

Previously the demos were created as a different set of hacks in the firmware,
simulating CPU behavior for hardware validation purposes only.

Now, with the whole machine running in Emulator I could rewrite these in
assembly running on "real" CPU.

The example code is available for inspection [on GitHub](https://github.com/X65/examples).
