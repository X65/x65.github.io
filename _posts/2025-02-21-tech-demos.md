I've spent the last week rewriting the tech demos for real machine hardware.

Previously, the demos were created as a various set of hacks in the firmware, simulating CPU behavior for hardware validation purposes only.

Now, with the whole machine running in the emulator, I could rewrite these in assembly running on the "real" CPU.

The example code is available for inspection [on GitHub](https://github.com/X65/examples).
