title: W65C816S CPU support in Emu

The preliminary version of *Emu* used an M6502 chip emulator. I've spent the past week+ working on extending it into a full-fledged [W65C816S CPU][1] emulator chip.

Once again, choosing [chip-emulators][2] as the base for *Emu* has proven to be a perfect choice.

The original `chip` CPU emulators are built from two parts:

- A C shell providing a `chip emulator` wrapper
- A Python script for an *instruction decoder generator*

The C header file provides integration with the rest of the system via chip pin emulation. The Python script works with a matrix of instruction operands and addressing modes - just like a real hardware CPU instruction decoder.

It was meticulous work for a real bean-counter, mapping the W65C816S datasheet to my freshly-forked `w65c816s_gen.py`, but I bet it was way easier than writing such an emulator from scratch. Especially with no prior experience.

In the process, I created a headless CPU simulator, inspired by a [CODE GOLF][3] post.

[This tool][4] allows me to run automated tests for the CPU implementation:

In interactive mode, it's even capable of running EhBASIC:

Things are looking goodâ€¦
